NEW RELEASE: Version 4.2.0 build 5 of &tau;-argus is now available. This version includes noise addition using the Cell Key Method for frequency count tables as well as magnitude tables.

**August 14, 2020** <br>
Small issue with the latest release (4.2.0 build 5) of &tau;-argus when installed in a directory that contains spaces (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)`). Two possible solutions: 
* Install in a directory _without_ spaces

or
* Replace the `ArgusLib.jar` in the `lib`-subdirectory of your &tau;-argus installation, by the one in [this zipfile](https://github.com/sdcTools/UserSupport/files/5074573/ArgusLib.zip)

The next release will be able to deal with directories with spaces again.
